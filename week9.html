This week we used a computer software called raspberry pi.  Rapberry bi is pretty much a really small computer that has games and certain coding things.  We were able to play minecraft on it and also make a LED board light up and scroll our name all due to coding in python.  This was a very interesting process as it was time consuming to code and make sure you put everything in right.
