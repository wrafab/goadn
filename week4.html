<H3> In week number four we ended up designing and making four things.  First, I decided to design the layout for my puzzle pieces and cut them.  The design could be made in fusion 360 by using lines and arcs to cut as many pieces as wanted.  Then the file was put into a laptop then the laser cutter did all the work from there as it vecorted out the pieces and you had your own puzzle. Next we had to design a cardboard box that was vectored and rastered.  For that you made a box design in corel draw and then you put what you wanted on the box.  Since the box was cardboard it did not want to stay together perfectly so i used a hot glue gun to hold it together.  Now we had to design two of four things and i decided to design a leather wristband and a blue water bottle.  The leather wristband was quite easy to design for that you had to open up corel draw but a thin rectangle on the screen and type the word or design you wanted in it.  Then the laser cutter ratered it out in the matter of a minute and then it was done.  My favorite one was the water bottle for that you had to download an image with a white background into corel draw size it and lay it horizontally to fit the bottle.  then you put it in the laser cutter on the raster settings and set it on these three wheels that rotated the bottle and put the logo i=on it right.  This week was a ton of fun and the water bottle is by far one of my favorite things we did!
