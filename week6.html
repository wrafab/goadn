This week the first thing we had to do was create vinyl stickers.  We had to make full color stickers.  For these i decided to make a FCA lacrosse stricker which a club lacrosse team for christian athletes and this team is insanely good and i used the sticker on the back of my laptop.  The next sticker i decided to make was a Nashville Predators sticker because they are my favorite NHL team and my cousin used to play for them so that went on the back of my laptop.  The next three one color stickers i decided to make were a UNC one a Clemson one and a Breast cancer Awareness sticker because it was october and it fit the month.
Second,  We had to make a mold of an image we wanted for a chocolate bar.  Unfortunantly i was absent for the two classes making this and a coaster due to being out of town.  I still was able to make a chocalate bar because Mr. Gerber had extra holiday mixes for me to use along with some others.

Third, We had to make a Coaster with an object in it.  Although i was not here i did get to see other peoples coasters and they looked extremely cool.  You had to mold and cast in a cup and it would seal your object in the coaster.
