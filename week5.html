First, we found the design rules and limitations for the MakerBot Replicator 5th Gen printers.  The first limitation is the object you want to print has to big enough that the printer will have enough accuracy and precsision to print, and small enough the MakerBot can print the entire object.  Second limitation is when printing/building, the machine has to build with layers because it is an additive machine.  Finally, your model, inorder to 3D print, cannot have multiple materials because on the MakerBot, it is impossible to have more than one material printing at the same time.

Second, we scanned our heads and used the program Meshmixer to combine our scanned heads and pedastal bases.  The scanning process took some time and I had to redo it because my first file became corrupted when trying to transfer the scan onto my computer.  I found the pedastal from Thingiverse so there was no real difficulty with downloading that file.  Another difficulty I found was combining the pedastal and head, and making sure they are sized correctly.  The pedastal seemed to be a lot larger than my head so it took some time resizing that to be proportional to my head.  Once all done, I sent the <a href="chloeb.stl"> file </a> to Mr.Gerber to print.

Third, we designed and printed a small 3D object that could not be made subtractively.  In order to do this, I had to do some research to figure out what that meant exactly, coming up with the simple definition of it can not be cut out or drilled into something to be made.  After figuring this out, I decided to go along with a hollow box design with a strip above it, making the whole thing not <a href="thing.stl"> subractible </a>.

Finally, Haley and I created a <a href="filter.stl"> drip irrigation </a> top for a water bottle.  On our first try, we ran into the problem many others experienced, the thread did not print out, leading to the top not screwing onto the water bottle.  After Mr. Gerber explained to us that you have to make it in model mode, not sketch, we were able to redesign our top and made sure to have the threads.  The hardest part in the process was getting the revolve tool to work as I wanted on Fusion 360.  I had sketched out a triangle to be the tip of the top and it took me about half a class to figure out how to orient the top triangle correctly.  When the final object was printed out, it came out with the threads, and actually screwed about halfway on the top of the water bottle.
