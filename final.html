This week was oour most important thing yet our final project!  This week we were allowed to make anything we wanted that was possible that we would present on the last day to the class.  For this i decided to make a LED light up sign to hang from my room.  Four processes had to be used so first off i had to go into the program corel draw and design my sign layout.  With this i was able to put the words and designs on there and changed them to be vectored.  I went with a Sweden hockey theme because i love the color pattern and sweden is one of my favorite National teams.  I put the crown logo on each side and the flag at the bottom.  next i tried the design by cutting it into about 5 different pieces of cardboard and on the 5th try everything aligned like i pictured so then i put the would in and let the laser machine vectore out everything.  Aftwr that i took the sign over to the spray paint area and soaked it in about three layers of yellow spray paint and let it dry.  Then i took a light blue acrillic and hot glued it on the back of the board so that would project the LED light through the sign.  Then Mr. gerber gave me the lights and the cord needed to make the sign light up.  i wrapped the light around the back of the sign then glued to lights down.  next i soldered the wires into the light so that would activate the lights.  One of the light pads fell off and Mr. gerber had to re solder it basically saving my project so big shout out there.  Then my sign was compketed and it came out pretty awesome!
