<H3>  For week number 1 we worked on building things with a team. We had about 20 minutes to construct a structure that would hold a cup filled with as many pennies as possible.  My group consisted of me J Gro, Henry "the lefty" Harkins, and jackson.  We had to make the structure with a cuple straws a cup, string, and tape.  My group made a very stable structure but.... we somehow cheated and the string was wrapped around the cup.  Oh well we fit all the pennies so thats a win for me!
