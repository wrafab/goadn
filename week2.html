<H3>  For week number two we worked individually to 3D print something out of a Maker Bot printer.  I decided to make my own phone case.  First we had to design the case and measure all of the dimensions in a program named fusion 360 then we had to import it to a flashdrive.  Lastly, we had to put the flash drive into the bot and print it, My case took about two and a half hours to print but in the end it came out pretty sweet!
